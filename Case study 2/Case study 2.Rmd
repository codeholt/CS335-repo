#Background
The graphic shows the data from the gapminder dataset. The Gapminder data is a collection of nations Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Life expentancy, Population, and the year the observations were made. In creating this graph, I learned that labels can be assigned to asthetics, the same way data can be assigned to asthetics. 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country != "Kuwait") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=lifeExp,
             y=gdpPercap,
             size=pop/100000,
             color=continent))+
  geom_point()+
  #makes each year a seperate graph
  facet_grid(. ~ year)+
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "sqrt")+
  labs(y= "GDP per capita", x="Life Expectancy",
       size ="Population (100k)",
       title = "Life expectancy rise by a countries Rise in GDP")
```
